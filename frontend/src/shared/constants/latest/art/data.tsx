      "Blou BOUTET (1708) Claude Boutet published his Traité de la peinture en mignature (Treaty of Painting in Miniature) in 1708. In it he illustrated two colour circles: one of seven colours and one of twelve. Above is the former, which contains yellow, orange, scarlet, crimson, violet, blue and green. The circles are thought to have been the first to have been based on the seven colours in Isaac Newton&apos;s optical spectrum (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo and violet). However, Boutet was unable to represent a true red with any pigment, so he employed two reds - fire red and crimson - and disregarded Newton&apos;s indigo.",
      "Green HARRIS (1766) Moses Harris (1730-c. 1788) was an English entomologist and engraver. He wrote several reference books on British insects, which he illustrated with detailed hand-coloured engravings. In his short treatise on colour, The Natural System of Colours (1766), he tried to show the enormous range of colours that could be mixed from the three primaries of red, blue and yellow, which he rendered with vermilion, ultramarine and king&apos;s yellow. He related these three &apos;primitives&apos; to the wild poppy, the cornbottle flower and the butter flower, or meadow ranunculus. By mixing these colours, he created three &apos;mediates&apos;: orange, green and purple. Harris then mixed each adjacent colour so that one of the two components predominated. This resulted in eighteen colours. He then subdivided each of the colours into twenty concentric circles of different saturation levels, to simulate the addition of black, to create a total of 360 hues in what he termed the prismatic circle (see above)."

      "Ignaz Schiffermüller (1727-1806) was an Austrian entomologist, whose main speciality was butterflies. In order to more accurately describe the insects he studied, he set out to identify the colours encountered in nature in Versuch eines Farbensystems (Experimental Colour System) published in 1772. ish veral -d 1, ried hat To begin with, he provided a model comprising a table of thirty-six different blues laid out in a three-by-twelve matrix. Names of the colours were provided in German, Latin and French in a similar fashion to later systems of the early twentieth century. llow. wilder. The work also contained a full-page engraving with a colour circle, hand-tinted with twelve colours shading, almost imperceptibly, one to another (see above).",
      "MAYER (1758) Tobias Mayer (1723-62) was a German mathematician and astronomer. In a lecture given to the Göttingen Academy of Sciences in 1758, he set out to identify the exact number of colours that the human eye is capable of perceiving. His colour triangle was based on the painters&apos; three primaries of red, yellow and blue, and he used vermilion, massicot and azurite to represent them. Mayer held that the human eye was not able to recognize small variations in colour so in his triangle he adopted gradients of twelve, using the three primary colours. Each colour mix therefore contained a notation that added up to twelve, together with the first letter of each colour: &apos;b&apos; for blau (blue), &apos;g&apos; for gelb (yellow) and &apos;r&apos; for rot (red). Thus, &apos;biigi&apos; represents eleven parts blue and one part yellow. The centre of the triangle was filled with colours produced by mixing all three pigments, resulting in a more complicated notation, for example, the parts again adding up to twelve."

      "In 1803, in Esthétique de la toilette ou du beau dans la toilette (Aesthetics of grooming or beauty in grooming), Friedrich Gotthelf Baumgärtner (1759-1843) and Ernst Müller (1764-1826) illustrated two twelve-part colour wheels with the following colours: Gelb; Feuerfarbe; Orange; Ziegelroth; Roth; Carmesin; Violet; Lilas; Blau; Meergrün; Grün; Gelbgrün (yellow; fire colour; orange; brick red; red; carmine; violet; purple; blue; sea green; green; yellow green). The work was designed to assist women with their choice of hairstyle, clothing and make-up. The last section of the book is dedicated to colour - principally the colour of clothing - and it shows which colours work best with particular skin and hair tones. It included two hand-tinted colour wheels that explained the laws of harmony and showed complementary colours.",

      "To display the 'three primitives', Sowerby employed gamboge, carmine and Prussian blue and these are displayed at three saturation levels as 'full tints', 'middle tints' and 'light tints' on the sides of the main triangle (above). Secondary mixes are shown in the corners of this triangle and ternary (three-part) mixes can be seen in the three rhombi at the bottom of the figure. A total of sixty-four colours are shown, including white, and in a separate diagram he identified each of them by a number and letter code."

      "Zur Farbenlehre (Theory of Colours, 1810) by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe (1748-1832) contained the poet's views on the nature of colours and how they are perceived by man. As Wittgenstein was to later point out, it was not so much a theory as a series of examples by which the reader could experience a number of different colour-related phenomena. He offered no real explanation of the nature of colour. This simple colour wheel (above) appeared in Goethe's first diagram (see p. 124). He explained that yellow, blue and red are placed triadically with their derived intermediates. Hence, the three primaries of red, yellow and blue, with the secondaries of green, orange and purple. The secondaries are placed opposite their complementary primaries - red opposite green, blue opposite orange and purple opposite yellow - or, as he wrote, '...for the colours diametrically opposed to each other...are those that reciprocally evoke each other in the eye'. This colour wheel anticipated Ewald Hering's opponent colour theory by more than fifty years. In a variation of this wheel, Goethe included various aesthetic qualities. He also associated red with the 'beautiful', orange with the 'noble', yellow with the 'good', green to the 'useful', blue to the 'common' and violet to the 'unnecessary'.",
      "HAYTER (1813) Charles Hayter (1761-1835) displayed three colour wheels under the heading 'The Painter's Compass', in his book: An introduction to perspective, dialogues between the author's children (1813). He added a compendium of genuine instruction in the art of drawing and painting (titled Letters on drawing and painting). Hayter's basic triangle, comprising the three primary colours yellow, red and blue, was well established by this time and the black centre was probably derived from the prismatic circle of Moses Harris (1766). He came to the conclusion that 'all transient or prismatic effects can be imitated with the Three Primitive Colors...but only in the same degree of comparison as white bears to LIGHT'. Once again, the colours are laid out triadically, with the complementary colours opposite each other on the wheel (above)."
